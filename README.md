# How to Run

todoapp file contains the Java and Spring Boot backend files. Importing this file in your preffered IDE should make you have all the necessary tools for running this project. Running TodoappApplication.java(under the src/main/java file) as a Java Application should start up the project. From this point on i would recommend Postman application for manipulating the data in our database. If not you can connect to H2 Database in address:

localhost:8080/h2-console

And have the JBDC URL as:

jdbc:h2:mem:todoapp
